## Typing stubs for mysqlclient

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `mysqlclient` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `mysqlclient`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/mysqlclient. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `7a81bd41e97a296b1a260f08820a25e806e8470c`.
